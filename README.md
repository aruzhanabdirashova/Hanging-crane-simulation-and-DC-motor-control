There were several assignments of "Industrial Automation" matter. I simulated nonlinear and linear model of "Hanging crane" using Simulink, comparing both of them on the presence of additive noise. In the end, I derived frequency domain description of the linearized model. In second assignemt, I designed position speed controller for the DC Motor using PID and appropriate Ziegler and Nichols method. On the last one, I used attached dataset to identify an ARX and NFIR model of the second output of process. But unfortunately, I did it in Matlab command line, and did not use System Identification Toolbox. Also, I messed up NFIR, wrongly writing code as for linear models. But it will be considered in later works, if done.
