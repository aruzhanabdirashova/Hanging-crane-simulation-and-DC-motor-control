I completed several assignments for my "Industrial Automation" course. In the first assignment, I simulated both nonlinear and linear models of a hanging crane using Simulink and compared their responses in the presence of additive noise. I also derived the frequency domain description of the linearized model.

In the second assignment, I designed a position-speed controller for a DC motor using a PID controller and applied the appropriate Ziegler-Nichols tuning method.

In the final assignment, I used the provided dataset to identify ARX and NFIR models of the process's second output. Unfortunately, I performed the modeling using MATLAB's command line instead of the System Identification Toolbox, and I mistakenly coded the NFIR model as if it were a linear model. I plan to address these issues in future work.
